 - Also, you can search a movie by its name in the search part of our header.(top right)
 - In the movie-info page, a non-login user can only watch the trailor of this movie and go through others' comments. But if user wants to use more functionalities of our website, he will need to sign up/sign in first!
 ** Tips: Since there are too many movies, our example data of 'comments' doesn't cover all of them. So if you want to see the example of other users' comments in the movie main page, you should use the movie 'Joker', 'Frozen II' or 'Hustlers'. (You can easily find them in the first section of index page)
 
# Instructions for Users
